# Slide Game

A Python implementation of a single-player game called **Slide**, developed as part of the CSCA08H course at the University of Toronto Scarborough.

## üìú Description

This is a text-based board game where players slide colored squares across a 2D grid to form matching sequences. The main game logic is divided between two files:

- `slide_functions.py`: Contains core logic and utility functions for manipulating the game board.
- `slide_game.py`: Contains the main game loop, user interaction, and game mechanics.

## üß© Features

- Board representation using a string-based grid
- Sliding mechanics for rows (left and right)
- Win condition checks for connected squares
- Input validation and error handling
- Constants for easy modification of board dimensions and gameplay rules
